# PostFach Landing Page

Welcome to the landing page repo for **PostFach** — an indie, privacy-friendly email client inspired by the legendary Mailbox app.

Built in spare time by a dad-of-two and punk guitarist who misses the days of Inbox Zero and design-driven mail apps. PostFach is *not* venture-backed, *not* ad-driven, and *not* another boring clone. Just a buttery-smooth, offline-first experience for people who want to enjoy email again.
